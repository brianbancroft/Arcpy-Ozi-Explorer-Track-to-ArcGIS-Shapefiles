A quick arcpy script. 

The purpose of this script is to convert Ozi Explorer track files
(a .plt ASCII file) into shapefile format through ArcGIS. 

As Arc is the current environment of my company, I will use ArcPy for this 
and other analysis scripts which will be built on this script. Intent is to create
something that can bulk-convert and analyze.
